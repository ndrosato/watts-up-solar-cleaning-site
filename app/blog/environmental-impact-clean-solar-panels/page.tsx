              When you installed solar panels, you made a significant commitment to renewable energy and reducing your
              carbon footprint. But did you know that keeping those panels clean isn't just about saving moneyâ€”it's also
              about maximizing your positive environmental impact?

            <h2 className="mt-8 text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900">How Dirty Panels Undermine Environmental Benefits</h2>

            <p>When solar panels become dirty, several environmental consequences occur:</p>

            <div className="my-6 rounded-lg border p-6 shadow-sm">
              <h3 className="mb-4 text-xl font-bold">1. Reduced Clean Energy Production</h3>

                <div className="md:w-2/3">
                  <p>
                    Dirty panels can lose 15-30% of their efficiency. This means that for every 10kW of potential clean
                    energy your system could produce, you're losing 1.5-3kW to dirt and grime.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mt-4">
                    <strong>Environmental Impact:</strong> This lost energy often needs to be compensated for by
                    traditional grid electricity, which typically comes from fossil fuels. In effect, dirty panels
                    indirectly increase carbon emissions.

              <h3 className="mb-4 text-xl font-bold">2. Shortened Panel Lifespan</h3>
              <p>
                Accumulated dirt, bird droppings, and debris can cause hot spots and permanent damage to solar cells.
                This can significantly reduce the lifespan of your panels.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-4">
                <strong>Environmental Impact:</strong> Solar panels have an embedded carbon footprint from their
                manufacturing process. When panels need to be replaced prematurely, this manufacturing footprint is
                spread over fewer years of clean energy production, reducing the net environmental benefit.
              </p>
              <div className="mt-4 rounded-lg bg-amber-50 p-4">
                <p className="text-amber-800">
                  <strong>Did you know?</strong> The typical carbon payback period for solar panels is 1-2 years. This
                  means it takes 1-2 years of clean energy production to offset the carbon emissions from manufacturing.
                  Maximizing panel lifespan is crucial to optimizing this environmental return on investment.

              <h3 className="mb-4 text-xl font-bold">3. Increased Water Usage</h3>
              <p>
                When panels become excessively dirty, they often require more intensive cleaning methods and more water
                to restore them to optimal condition.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-4">
                <strong>Environmental Impact:</strong> Regular, light cleaning uses less water overall than occasional
                deep cleaning of heavily soiled panels. Professional cleaning services like ours use water-efficient
                methods and equipment to minimize water usage.
